<p>Your competitor is {{ competitor.name }} </p>

<p>You are now asked to choose between two options</p>


<p>
    <strong>Option 1: Proceed to compete alongside {{ teammate.name }}.</strong>
    In this case your final score will be an average of your score and {{ teammate.name }}'s score.
    So, for example, if you get a score of 4, and {{ teammate.name }} gets a score of 2 your final score will be 3.
    If both you and {{ teammate.name }} get 5 your final score will be 5 etc.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Option 2: Don’t compete and instead let {{ teammate.name }} compete in your place.</strong> 
    In this case, {{ teammate.name }} will compete twice.
    Your final score will be an average of both of {{ teammate.name }}’s scores.
    So, for example, If {{ teammate.name }} scores 2 and 4, your final score will be 3.
    If {{ teammate.name }} scores 5 and 5 your final score will be 5 etc.
</p>
