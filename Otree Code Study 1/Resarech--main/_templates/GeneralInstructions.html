<p>Thank you for participating in this study.</p>

<p>
    In this following study you will be asked to participate in several competitive matches. The competition in these matches will include solving math questions quickly and accurately. These questions are from the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). 
    Each question will test your aptitude in Arithmetic Reasoning. In addition to being used by the military to determine which jobs armed service members are qualified for, performance on the ASVAB is often used as a measure of cognitive ability by academic researchers.
    You will be asked to solve as many such math questions as possible within 150 seconds.
